* Crossbow
* Lylek Games
*
* Thank you for purchasing this asset!
*
* To add the crossbow to your scene, simply drag and drop the Character prefab from the
* Prefabs folder into your scene; or use the Crossbow prefab, and attach it to your own
* player character.
* 
* CROSSBOW-SHOOT SCRIPT
* A CrossbowShoot script is attached to the Crossbow for animation, as well as to instantiate arrow
* projectiles with use of the Left Mouse Button. Both javascript and cs scripts are provided.
*
* Components:
* Arrow Spawn - the position to spawn the arrow
* Projectile - the arrow to be instantiated
* Draw Sound - the sound to be played when reloading (when the string and bolt are drawn back) [no sound file included]
* Shoot Sound - the sound to be played when the arrow is shot [no sound file included]
* Power - the force applied to the arrow
* Destroy Time - the length of time until the arrow will be destroyed, after instantiation
* Destroy Arrow - whether or not the arrow will be destroyed | if this is unchecked, Destroy Time will have no effect
*
* ARROW-STUCK SCRIPT
* The arrow instantiated by the crossbow is the Bolt prefab, found in the Prefabs folder. This prefab also
* contains a script, called BoltStuck. Arrows will penetrate surfaces and stick in place. Arrows will also
* perform as if they were top-heavy.
*
* Components:
* Hit Sound - sound to be played when arrows penetrate a surface. [no sound file included]
